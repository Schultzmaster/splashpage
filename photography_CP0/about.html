<h2> A brief History </h2>
<p> Jacobeau Schultz was born under a full moon, making him a reverse werewolf. Every full moon he undergoes a drastic transformation that renders him less interesting than he was before. This is opposite because werewolves get more interesting- grow hair, get larger, ect - unlike Jacobeau. </p>

<p>His home life is tranquil, and disturbed only by the fact that all of his appliances talk. They do this only when no one else is around, but he was able to record samples and other people have varified that it's weird, but not creepy. Mostly they just talk about the weather, which is ironic because they're indoors.</p>

<p>Jacobeau enjoys photography because it a creative outlet that generates a work of art, but the art is in the capturing, not in creation - as it is in painting. Photography requires you to move around the subject and understand the relationships between objects, colors, subjects. While it is not the art of capturing things exactly as they are, it is an art that cannot be replicated in any other form.</p>
