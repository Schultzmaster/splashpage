Almost there!!!

Just to add the stuff to the digital ocean server, and that's it for this project























I'm trying to get the Stack exchange API working, it seems a much more involved process than the weather

Do I need to register for an API key? How do I do that if my domain 45.55.143.16 can't be registered?

How do I actually submit information?
JSON response will be dealt with once I can ask questions

https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/info?site=stackoverflow&key=app key



My eyes hurt and I want to quit. I think this is the most important time to be doing this

Right now, I want to .... set up a good looking Weather page, using more than just C/P my old stuff

Bootstap seems a good new thing to learn


Things to do::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


email Dr Zappala about the StackExchange api


add the suggested clothing feature by keying it to the basic weather returned, maybe some pics?

figure out whitespace for the data

? add the sites to buy suggested clothing from

? add things to do in that weather type?

? add places to go in that weather type?

double check both for bad input

add a default case for showcasing?

______________________
DONE::weed out tags you don't need for the weather page

DONE::remake the index page after this the weather one (do this bit by bit to learn the bootstrap tags?)
