<h1> Reviews from real people/minerals</h1>

<h3>JRR Tolkein</h3>
<p> The Mountains were particularily interesting. Not quiet as good as Mordor, but they get the point across. The plants were cool, but what people really like is giant spiders. Take more photos of those. </p>

<h3>Anonymous User</h3>
<p> Get rich quick! Work from Home! I used this at home marketing kit and I made 3000 a week from my own living room! Call today! Lose weight! Take a shower! Did you think those were part of the kit? Wrong! You should just do them anyway. </p>

<h3> Lithium, the third element </h3>
<p> Pretty good portfolio, though somewhat lacking in it's coverage of lithium. </p>
